GET GOOD


Bob tried to get good. He started going to the gym ("The gym is now my church," he said). When he was at the gym, he always went for quad exercises. At first he could only do 5 lbs. But Bob said to himself "you can't give up now you gotta get good." So he kept trying very hard. Eventually after a few years he was able to do 250 lbs which is the most the gym had. The gym owner Turtoise said approvingly "wow Bob great job you did it." Bob however didn't want to stop. "I need more weights I am going for 300," Bob demanded. "Dude we don't have more weights," said Turtoise. "No we do," smiled Bob. He crawled to the quad machine next to him, ripped it apart and started adding weight to his own quad machine. Turtoise gaped in disbelief but now Bob's got great quads, he's too powerful and there's no way Turtoise can stop him. "There we go," Bob said.
